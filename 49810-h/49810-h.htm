<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">Nobody</span> who has lived in modern times has so stirred up the world
as Napoleon Bonaparte. Nobody has upset so many old things, and
started so many new ones. No man ever lived who had more faith
in his own powers&mdash;and less respect for those of other men. Napoleon
had, too, an unusual combination of those personal qualities which excite
and interest men. It is nearly a hundred years since he dropped out of
active life; but his story is more rather than less thrilling as time goes on.</p>

<p>There was nothing in his birth or schooling or his first activities in life
to lead one to expect an unusual career. His family was poor and servile;
his father trading on his name and his acquaintances to feed, educate, and
place his family. The most promising thing about young Bonaparte was
his resentment of this servility and his own flat refusal to participate in
it to help himself. Throughout his boyhood in the island of Corsica,
where he was born in 1769, during the six years he spent at school in
France and the eight years of intermittent military service that followed
his first appointment at the age of sixteen to a second lieutenancy, he
lived a tempestuous inner life. Ambition for himself, devotion to his family,
love for Corsica, hatred of France, sympathy for the new ideas of
human rights that were stirring Europe,&mdash;these sentiments kept the mind
and heart of the young officer in tumult and made him waver between
allegiance to the land in which he was born and the land that had trained
him; between the career of a soldier that was his passion and a career of
money making, in order to educate his brothers, settle his sisters, and put
his mother into a secure position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span></p>

<h3 class="wspace">NAPOLEON THE OPPORTUNIST</h3>

<p>It is quite fair, I think, to characterize
his early career as that of an adventurer.
He was watching for a chance, and had
determined to take it, regardless of where
it offered itself. It was at a moment when
he was in disgrace for having refused the
orders of his superiors in the army that the
chance he wanted came.</p>

<p>The convention in which at that moment
the French government centered was
attacked by the revolting Parisians. Bonaparte
had no particular sympathy with the
convention,&mdash;in fact, he had more with the
rebels,&mdash;but when one of his friends in the
government who knew his ability as an
artillery officer asked him to take charge of
the force protecting the Tuilleries, where
the convention sat, he accepted&mdash;with hesitation; but, having accepted,
he did his work with a skill and daring that earned him his first important
command, that of general in chief of the French Army of the Interior.
Four months later he was made commander in chief of the Army of Italy,
the army that was disputing the conquest of northern Italy with Austria.</p>

<h3 class="wspace">THE ITALIAN CAMPAIGN</h3>

  <div class="caption"><p>WHERE AN EMPEROR WAS BORN</p>

<p class="captionsub">In this room Napoleon was born in 1769.</p></div></div>

<p>It was a ragged, disgusted, and half-revolting body, this Army of Italy,
one that for three years had been conspicuous mainly for inactivity. Without
waiting even for shoes, the new commander started it out swiftly
on a campaign that for clever
strategy, for rapidity of movement,
for dash and courage in
attack, was unlike anything
Europe had ever seen. In less
than two months he drove his
opponents from Lombardy and
had shut up the remnant of
their army in Mantua. The
Austrians shortly had a new
army in the field. It took
eight months to defeat it and
capture Mantua; but it was
accomplished in that period.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
Austria then called her ablest general, Archduke Charles, and gave him
one hundred thousand men with which to avenge her disasters. With
half the number Bonaparte advanced to meet the archduke, and drove
him step by step to Vienna.</p>

<p>After a year and seven months of campaigning General Bonaparte,
now twenty-eight years old, signed his first treaty. By that treaty he
formed a new republic in northern Italy and made a new eastern frontier
for France. Before the treaty,
however, he had filled her
empty treasury, had loaded
her down with works of art,
and had given her a new place
in Europe; a place that he
had proved he could sustain.</p>

<p>The glory of the Italian
campaign thrilled the French
people; but it disturbed the
politicians in power. Bonaparte
saw that if the government
could manage it he
would have no further opportunities
for distinguishing
himself. It was this sense
that led him to urge that
England, the only nation then
in arms against France, be
attacked by invading Egypt.
The government consented
promptly. It was a way of
disposing of Bonaparte. What
the government did not
dream, of course, was that
Bonaparte with this army hoped to found an oriental kingdom of which
he should be the ruler.</p>

<p>But nothing went as he expected. He suffered terrible reverses, which
he knew the government at home was using to break his hold on the people;
his supplies and information were cut off; his prestige in his own
army weakened; his faith in his destiny was shaken. That the effect of
this bad fortune was not more than skin deep was clear enough when he
accidentally learned that things were in a very bad way in France, that
much of what he had gained in Italy had been lost, and that Austria and
Russia were preparing an invasion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span></p>

<h3 class="wspace">FIRST CONSUL OF FRANCE</h3>

<p>Promptly and secretly Bonaparte
slipped out of Egypt,
and before the powers at home
knew of his intention he was
in France and the people were
welcoming him as their deliverer.
He was ready to be
just that. It was no great
trick for a man of his daring
and sagacity, adored by the
populace, to overturn a discredited
and inefficient government
and make himself
dictator. It was done in a few
weeks, and France had a new
form of government, a consulate,
of which the head was a
first consul, and Bonaparte
was the first consul.</p>

<p>The most brilliant and
fruitful four years of Napoleon
Bonaparte’s life followed; for
it was then that he set out to
bring order and peace to a
country demoralized and exhausted by generations of plundering by privileged
classes, followed by a decade of revolution against privileges. France
needed new machinery of all kinds, and this Bonaparte undertook to
supply. There were many people who regarded him as a great general;
but to their amazement he now proved himself a remarkable statesman.</p>

<h3 class="wspace">NAPOLEON THE STATESMAN</h3>

<p>He attacked the question of the national income like a veteran financier.
The first matter was reorganizing taxation. He succeeded in distributing
the burden more justly than had ever been known in France. The
taxes were fixed so that each knew what he had to pay, and the inordinate
graft that tax collectors and police had enjoyed was cut off. New financial
institutions were devised; among them the Bank of France. The economy
he instituted in the government, the army, his own household, everywhere
that his power extended, was rigid and minute; as he personally examined
all accounts, there was no escape. The waste and parasitism that pervaded
the country began to give way for the first time since the Revolution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span></p>

<p>Industries of all kinds had sickened in the long period of war. Bonaparte
undertook their revival by one of the most severe applications ever
made of the doctrine of protection,&mdash;he even attempted to make his women
folk wear no goods not made in France! His interest in agriculture was
as keen as in manufacturing, and his personal suggestions and interference
of the same nature. The prosperity of the country was stimulated
greatly by the public works Bonaparte undertook. One can go nowhere
in France today without finding them. It was he who set the country at
road building. Some of the most magnificent highways in Europe were
laid out by him, including those over four Alpine passes. He paid great
attention to improving harbors. Those now at Cherbourg, Havre, and
Nice, as well as at Flushing and Antwerp, Bonaparte planned and began.
As for Paris, his ambition for the city was boundless. He was responsible
for some of her finest features
and monuments.</p>

<p>His greatest civil achievement
was undoubtedly the
codification of the laws, and
it was the one of which he
was proudest. That he contributed
much to the Code
Napoleon besides the driving
power that insisted that it be
promptly put through, there
is no doubt. His great contribution
was the inestimable
one of commonsense. He had
no patience with meaningless
precedents, conventions, and
technicalities. He wanted laws
that everybody could understand
and would recognize as
necessary and just.</p>

  <div class="caption">NAPOLEON AS FIRST CONSUL</div></div>

<p>Nothing more daring was
undertaken in this period by
Bonaparte than his reëstablishment
of the Catholic
Church and his recall of thousands
of members of the old
régime driven out of the country
by the Revolution. It was
an attempt to reconcile and
restore the two most powerful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
enemies of the Revolution, the two that
the first consul knew Europe would never
cease to fight to restore to power. There
was of course great opposition in radical
and republican circles to both ventures.</p>

<h3 class="wspace">EMPEROR OF THE FRENCH</h3>

<p>What Napoleon aimed at was to fit together
all the different elements that had
made France, under a government that he
should direct, and then to impose upon them
all peace, industry, and loyalty. Considering
the character
and history
of the
elements he
was working
with, the degree of his success is one of the
wonders of statecraft. As time went on,
however, he was subjected to more and
more jealousy, criticism, and intrigue. And
as he saw his power questioned his grasp
tightened. He even began to employ the
tactics of despots,&mdash;espionage,
censorships,
summary
punishments.
The
upshot of the
attacks upon
him and of his determination to impose
his own will was that in 1804, when he
was thirty-five years old, he had himself
made emperor of the French. I think
there is no doubt that Napoleon believed
that this was the only method by which
he could make the position of France in
Europe impregnable; but that he was willing
to play the emperor there is no doubt.
The dream of a throne where he should
rule&mdash;for the welfare and happiness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
everybody concerned, no doubt, but rule&mdash;brilliantly and absolutely&mdash;had
never left his mind since boyhood&mdash;and now it was a fact accomplished!</p>

<p>The spectacle that followed is almost unbelievable. Napoleon with
perfect seriousness set about to train himself, his lovable, but vain and
unprincipled empress, Josephine, his selfish and vulgar family, his train
of rough intimates of the battlefield, to the etiquette, ceremonies, and dignity
of a court. He worked with the same energy, attention to details,
and with the same insistence on complete obedience as when directing a
campaign. The Napoleonic
court achieved
real brilliance and dignity;
but to those born
to the purple it was
always an upstart’s
court. That it was far
and away more moral,
economic, and orderly,
as well as more serviceable
to France, counted
for little with those of
the old régime.</p>

<p>The year after Napoleon
was crowned
emperor of the French
(1804) he had himself
crowned king of Italy.
The territory he now
governed included not
only these two countries,
but several Germanic
states. It was an
enormous power, and
the old kingdoms of
Europe, England, Austria,
and Russia looked on in dismay. It was not only his power, backed as
it was by his genius, but it was the ideas he was spreading. Everywhere
he went he put his new code of laws into force, and preached, even if he did
not always practise, personal liberty, equality before the law, religious tolerance,&mdash;ideas
that many of his enemies feared more than they did armies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span></p>

<p>A coalition against
him was inevitable, and
in 1805 he took the field
again. The campaigns
that followed closely in
the next four years include
some of his most
interesting military feats,&mdash;the
battle of Austerlitz,
of which he was proudest
himself; the campaign of
Jena, by which he humbled
Prussia, increased
French territory largely,
and won the czar of Russia
as an ally; the war on
Spain, which ended in his
own deserved defeat (Napoleon
at St. Helena characterized
his attack on
Spain as “unjust,” “cynical,”
“villainous”); the
campaign of Wagram,
which finally humbled his
persistent enemy Austria.</p>

<p class="captionsub">For reasons of state Napoleon divorced the Empress Josephine to
marry Marie Louise, the daughter of the emperor of Austria. His
last words to the woman who loved him were: “My destiny and
France demand it!”</p></div></div>

<p>At the end of these
four years Napoleon was
himself the practical master
of Europe; the only
nation not recognizing his
power being England,
which was at least temporarily
quiet. He had
created an empire; but
what was he to do with it? He had no heir. To provide for one he
carried out a plan long considered,&mdash;he divorced Empress Josephine
and married again. The new empress was the daughter of the old and
now humbled enemy of France, the emperor of Austria. Napoleon apparently
believed that on the birth of an heir France would accept him
fully, and that Europe would cease to fear and resent his power. He was
wrong. He had stripped too many of wealth and position, outraged too
many social and religious conventions, set in motion too many ideas hostile
to those that Europe as a whole lived by. His demands on subjects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
and allies were too heavy, and particularly the one that he had most at
heart,&mdash;that no continental nation should allow a dollar’s worth of England’s
goods to cross its borders. His punishment of those who displeased
him and disobeyed his orders was too severe. A revolt against his monstrous
assumption was inevitable.</p>

  <div class="caption">THE BATTLE OF WATERLOO</div></div>

<p>It was with his ally, Russia, that the first break came. That Napoleon
was startled by the idea of war with Alexander and sought to prevent
it, is certain; but Alexander refused to yield to his demand that the
embargo against English goods be enforced. The embargo he had set down
as the “fundamental law of the Empire.” There was nothing to do but
settle it by arms, and in the summer of 1812, with an army of over
half a million men, he began a reluctant and hesitating march
against Russia. It was a campaign of terrible disasters. The Russians
retreated before him, letting cold and hunger do the work of battles.
So effectively did they work that the French army was practically destroyed.
The Russian campaign is one of the most appalling in history.
It was but the beginning of his overthrow. Alexander raised the cry
“Deliver Europe!” Stein and other liberal minds rallied the youth of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
German states into a
league, pledged to fight
for national freedom.
His allies and dependences
began to demand
the return of lost territories
as a price of
loyalty. France revolted
at the prospects
of continued bloodshed.
The campaigns
thrust upon him by
all these forces were
fought; but frequently
without his old genius.</p>

<p>It was June of 1812 when Napoleon
began the Russian campaign. Twenty-one
months later Paris capitulated to
his allied enemies, and a few weeks later
he had lost the greatest empire modern
Europe had seen gathered under one
man, and was an exile in the little
island of Elba.</p>

<h3 class="wspace">WATERLOO AND ST. HELENA</h3>

<p>His dramatic escape from Elba;
the scurry out of France at news of his arrival of all who had opposed
him, leaving the coast practically clear for him; the rally of the army and
people to him; the immediate attack upon him by the allied powers of
Europe; his defeat at Waterloo and speedy exile to St. Helena,&mdash;these
make perhaps the most dramatic succession of events in all history, and
it was not he who lost by the record of them, though it ended in his captivity.
Napoleon a prisoner on an island six hundred miles from land
was Napoleon still. He was there because of his conquerors’ fear of him.
No greater tribute to one man’s power was ever paid than that of Europe
when under English leadership she consented to confine Napoleon
Bonaparte on the island of St. Helena. It was all that was needed to
impress him forever on the world as one of heroic mold.</p>

<p>For some time past we have felt that
the cover of The Mentor has been of
rather a “severe and formal” cut, and
that it would be well for us to adopt a
design that was composed of lines that
were somewhat more gracious and flowing.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>We have chosen this cover after a number
of experiments. It has not been an
easy matter to settle. The Mentor, as
we have stated more than once, is not
simply a magazine. It does not call for
the usual magazine cover treatment.
What we have always wanted and have
always sought for from the beginning has
been a cover that would express, in the
features of its design, the quality of the
publication. In the endeavor to make
clear by dignified design the educational
value and importance of The Mentor, the
tendency would be to lead on to academic
severity&mdash;and that we desire least of all.
On the other hand, it would be manifestly
inappropriate to wear a coat of many
colors. The position of The Mentor in
the field of publication is peculiar&mdash;its interest
unique. How best could its character
be expressed in decorative design?</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>We believe that Mr. Edwards has given
us in the present cover a fitting expression
of the character of The Mentor. It is unusual
in its lines&mdash;that is, for a periodical.
It has the quality of a fine book cover design&mdash;at
least so we think. It will, we believe,
invite readers of taste and intelligence
to look inside The Mentor, and as
experience has taught us, an introduction
to The Mentor usually leads on to continued
acquaintance.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>We want The Mentor to be regarded as
a companion. It has often been said that
books are friends. We give you in The
Mentor the good things out of many books,
and in a form that is easy to read and that
taxes you little for time. A library is a
valuable thing to have&mdash;if you know how
to use it. But there are not many people
who know how to use a library. If you
are one of those who don’t know, it would
certainly be worth your while to have a
friend who could take from a large library
just what you want to know and give it
to you in a pleasant way. The Mentor
can be such a friend to you.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>And since the word “library” has been
used, let us follow that just a bit further.
The Mentor may well become <em>yourself</em>
in library form. Does that statement
seem odd? Then let us put it this
way: The Mentor is a cumulative library
for you, each day, each week&mdash;a library
that grows and develops as you grow and
develop&mdash;a library that has in it just the
things that you want to know and ought
to know&mdash;and nothing else. Day by day
and week by week you add with each
number of The Mentor something to your
mental growth. You add it as you add to
your stature&mdash;by healthy development;
and the knowledge that you acquire in
this natural, agreeable way becomes a permanent
possession. You gather weekly
what you want to know, and you have it
in an attractive, convenient form. It becomes
thus, in every sense, <em>your</em> library,
containing the varied things that you
know. And you have its information and
its beautiful pictures always ready to hand
to refer to and to refresh your mind.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<span class="subhead">AT THE BRIDGE AT ARCOLE</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">“Follow</span> your general!” was the cry
with which young Bonaparte urged
his army to victory at Arcole. He
was only twenty-seven years old at the
time&mdash;and yet was commander in chief
of the army of Italy. The years that
brought Napoleon into prominence had
been troublous ones. He was born in
Corsica, and in moderate circumstances.
The exact date of his birth is uncertain.
At school he said it was 1768. It is
stated that he gave this date because that
made him a citizen of Genoa, inasmuch
as Corsica was at that time a dependency
of Genoa. Later on he said that he was
born in 1769; for Corsica had then become
a French possession, and this made
him a Frenchman by birth. After early
schooling at Brienne young Napoleon
entered the military academy of Paris in
1784. After a year he was commissioned
as a sublieutenant in the regular army,
and made rapid progress from the start.
As lieutenant colonel he distinguished
himself in the wars of Spain. He held
the mobs boldly and in masterful manner
during the turbulent scenes in the early
days of the Revolution. Barras, a high
official, recognized his military genius
and gave Bonaparte command of the
army of Italy.</p>

<p>The capture of the bridge at Arcole was
essential to the success of the Italian
campaign. For three days the Austrian
army gallantly opposed the attacks of
Napoleon’s forces, and it was only by
the personal courage of the young general
that victory was finally won. Bonaparte
personally led a rush across the
bridge at Arcole, and he was the real
vital force in the battle. He saw his
staff killed or wounded about him during
the onslaughts. Once he himself was
swept by a counter attack of the Austrian
forces into a swamp, where he
nearly perished.</p>

<p>Napoleon’s army consisted of 18,000
men, which he had moved over the narrow
and rugged roads with heavy baggage
at a rate of fourteen miles a day
for three consecutive days,&mdash;the same
rate at which Stonewall Jackson made
his marches through the Shenandoah
Valley. It was a remarkable achievement
under the conditions Napoleon had
to face.</p>

<p>And with this force he met an Austrian
army of 40,000 and defeated it signally
after a bitter engagement.</p>

<span class="subhead">EMPEROR NAPOLEON</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap i"><span class="uppercase">“I shall</span> now give myself to the administration
of France.” That was
the statement of Napoleon Bonaparte
in 1802 after he had overthrown the government
and had instituted a consulate,
to which he was elected first for ten
years, and then for life. There were
three consuls, and Napoleon was known
as the first consul. To one of his sublime
ambition, however, the thought of association
in government was unbearable.
Two years later, despite his attitude expressed
in his own words, “I am a friend
of the Republic; I am a son of the Revolution;
I stand for the principles of liberty,
equality, and fraternity,” Napoleon
determined to make an office for
himself that would be absolute and
hereditary. The title of king had grown
hateful to the people of France; so Napoleon
chose “emperor” instead, and in
1804 he assumed the title and the office.</p>

<p>Many were shocked; but none could
resist his assumption of imperial power.
A popular vote showed that only 2,500
people opposed the new government.
Pope Pius VII accepted Napoleon’s request
to take part in the coronation ceremony
on December 2, 1804. The event
occurred at Notre Dame Cathedral.
The pope poured the mystic oil on the
head of the kneeling sovereign. It was
ten centuries since any pope had left
Rome for a coronation, and in the minds
of the Latin peoples this was a consecration
of a monarch that put him on an
equal plane with the proudest rulers of
Europe, whose power reposed on the
basis of Divine Right. When the pope
lifted the crown Napoleon performed an
act so striking in its originality that the
people held their breath. He took the
crown from the pope’s hands and placed
it on his own head. He then crowned
Empress Josephine.</p>

<p>A few months later Napoleon journeyed
to Milan, the capital of what was
called the Cisalpine Republic, and there
proclaimed the kingdom of Italy. He
crowned himself then with “the iron
crown of the Lombards” and named
Prince Eugène, his stepson, heir to the
throne.</p>

<p>During the ceremonies the republic of
Genoa sent ambassadors to Paris with
the request to be incorporated into the
French empire. This offended Austria,
and led to the third war with that empire
since 1792, when the republic of
France was proclaimed.</p>

<span class="subhead">FRIEDLAND&mdash;“1807”</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">Emperor Napoleon’s</span> brilliant
victory at Friedland was the event
that placed him at the topmost
height of his military power. In a fierce
battle, noted for the strategy characteristic
of Bonaparte, he defeated a large
Russian army. This was on June 14, 1807.</p>

<p>Czar Alexander of Russia had refused
to comply with the demands of Napoleon
regarding trade with England. England
would not recognize Napoleon as emperor,
and he retorted by forcing several
of the European nations to sever commercial
connections with England. Czar
Alexander held out. The forces of both
emperors met at a small town called
Heilsberg, near Friedland. Napoleon
disposed his army in such a way that he
led the Russian general, Bennigsen, to
believe that he had to conquer only a
small number at Friedland. Part of
the French army was hidden in the semi-circle
of wooded hills that surrounded
Friedland.</p>

<p>From one of these hills Napoleon
watched the movement of Bennigsen and
his army of 30,000. The Russian general
believed that a corps of 1,500 men in
command at Lannes, stationed at Friedland,
was the extent of the forces opposing
him. Bennigsen engaged in a skirmish
with this corps, and drove it back into
the city. The Russian army then followed,
and crossed the River Albe. Napoleon
waited, feeling assured that Bennigsen
would not have time to retreat.
Then he brought his army of 60,000 men
to the aid of Lannes, and surrounded the
Russians, pouring upon them a converging
fire which worked disastrous results.
The fragments of Bennigsen’s army retreated
to the Russian border, whither
Napoleon’s forces pursued them.</p>

<p>At the Russian frontier Napoleon received
a communication from Czar Alexander
requesting peace. It was agreed
that the two emperors should meet on a
floating raft near the city of Tilsit.</p>

<p>The result of this conference was the
foundation of what has been called “Napoleon’s
dream to build a vast European
empire.”</p>

<p>Whatever may be said of that, it was
surely the beginning of his downfall.</p>

<span class="subhead">RETREAT FROM MOSCOW</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">Napoleon’s</span> invasion of Russia
was one of the most disastrous
military enterprises in the history
of the world. It was not the Russians
that defeated the emperor. During
much of his advance he was left alone.
Sometimes he was harrassed by skirmish
forces. Several great battles were fought,
notably that of Borodino. But for the
most part he was allowed to go on his
way; for his enemies knew that he had
greater than human forces to face and
battle with,&mdash;the vast Russian solitudes
and the cruel, killing Russian winter.
The terrible story is summed up in the
statement that Napoleon invaded Russia
with an armed force numbering more
than 500,000 men, and that he returned
with less than 30,000.</p>

<p>Bonaparte had once said, “I will never
lead an army to destruction as did Charles
XII on the steppes of Russia. My soldiers
are my children.” However, when
Czar Alexander of Russia refused to accept
his terms, Napoleon assembled his
grand army of Frenchmen, Italians, Austrians,
and Germans and invaded Russia
as far as Moscow, a distance of 2,000
miles from Paris.</p>

<p>He was victorious at Moscow; but the
Russians burned the city, and thus destroyed
it for purposes of winter quarters.
The czar delayed in his negotiations
for peace so long that Napoleon was compelled
to order a retreat, which began on
October 19, 1812. His army was then
harassed from the rear, and many lives
were lost in these engagements. After
two weeks of marching the soldiers met
the first wave of Russian winter. The
roads were frozen sheets of ice, and in a
week nearly all the horses perished. The
cavalry could no longer ward off the attacks
of Cossacks. Many of the guns
had to be abandoned. The army lacked
the artillery necessary to fight a big battle.
Food supplies had to be abandoned,
as there were no horses to draw them.
Thousands stretched out by the fire at
night never to awaken in the morning.
Cold and starvation killed them.</p>

<p>At Smolensk the army presented an
appalling spectacle. Napoleon headed
it, clad in furs, his expression set and
stern. Behind him came the captains,
majors, and lieutenants, then a few harnessed
wagons with the emperor’s war
chest and papers; after that the straggling
forces, many of them unarmed,
limping, half frozen, some wandering
away with wild looks, others falling by
the roadside never to rise again.</p>

<p>At the frontier Napoleon left this pitiful
fragment of an army in charge of the
king of Naples, took a horse, and rode to
Paris.</p>

the fate of Europe. Napoleon faced the
allied forces of Prussia, England, Germany,
and the Dutch, and had assembled
an army of 70,000 to meet them. The
allied forces were under command of the
Duke of Wellington. They were bound
together by one stern purpose,&mdash;to annihilate
once for all the man whom they
called the scourge of Europe. A heavy
rainstorm prevented the emperor from
carrying out his original plan of attack,
which was to meet the enemy in two sections.
The night of June 17 was stormy.
A heavy rainstorm made the roads so
heavy that the emperor could not move
his cannon into the place desired until a
short time before the enemy’s forces
joined. Then, too, General Grouchy had
been instructed to intercept the Prussian
forces under Blücher, and hold them
back while Napoleon fought his fight
with Wellington. If he could not do
that, he was at least to follow Blücher to
Waterloo. The arrival, therefore, of
Blücher and his forces in good fighting
trim put the French into such confusion
that a crushing defeat was inevitable.
In the rout men had to save themselves
as best they could.</p>

<p>Napoleon left the field, and took the
road to Paris, where he found his power
gone. He resigned as emperor in favor
of his son, and went to Rochefort in hope
of finding a ship going to the United
States. The English vessel Bellerophon
blockaded the harbor, and Napoleon
boarded it, throwing himself on the mercy
of Great Britain. He reckoned, however,
without his host; for England had never
forgotten that Napoleon had threatened
an invasion of Great Britain. Moreover,
within the year Napoleon had been declared
an international outlaw, “outside
the pale of social and civil relations, and
liable to public vengeance.”</p>

<p>So, as Napoleon crossed the English
Channel from Rochefort to Portsmouth,
with Captain Maitland, on board his
Majesty’s ship Bellerophon, he had
sought safety in the lion’s mouth. England
assumed charge of him on behalf of
all Napoleon’s European enemies, and
consigned him to exile on the island of
St. Helena.</p>

<span class="subhead">AT ST. HELENA</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">On</span> a rock-bound island in the South
Atlantic the greatest military genius
of all time spent the last six
years of his life. There Napoleon dragged
out the months in company with a number
of his former associates, recalling the
glories of the past and complaining of
the bitter conditions of the present.
There he wrote interesting memorial
papers and gave expression to the ripe
results of his military training.</p>

<p>Sir Hudson Lowe, a British military
officer with little tact or diplomacy, was
his jailer. It was not possible for such a
man and Napoleon Bonaparte to meet on
terms of amity. Writers on the subject
differ, as they do on almost all the episodes
of Napoleon’s life. Some say that
Sir Hudson abused and insulted Napoleon
shamefully. However, there are
French writers who try to prove that
Napoleon continually lied to and intrigued
against the governor.</p>

<p>Napoleon’s mind during these days
turned frequently toward his son, “the
little king of Italy,” and he dictated
many instructions as to the boy’s future.
It might have been with the hope that
at some future time an empire might
come to his son that he also dictated
those elaborate memoirs in which he gave
an account of himself.</p>

<p>During a terrific storm of wind and
rain on the night of May 5, 1821, Napoleon
died. The dash of the waves and the
roar of the storm seemed to stir his fading
faculties and to arouse in him a memory
of the din of battle; for his last words
were “Tête d’armée” (the head of the
army), and with that ejaculation in a
sharp military tone his lips closed forever.</p>

<p>He was buried near his favorite haunt,&mdash;a
fountain shaded by weeping willows,
at Longwood, the estate on which he had
lived at St. Helena. British soldiers accompanied
his body to rest with reversed
arms and fired a parting salute over his
grave.</p>

<p>In his will the following extraordinary
statement appeared: “My wish is to be
buried on the banks of the Seine, in the
midst of the French people, whom I so
dearly loved.”</p>

<p>In 1840 his body was ceremoniously
transferred to Paris and buried in the
Hôtel des Invalides with every circumstance
of military pomp and national
mourning.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
